\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of Giza -- a strongly
consistent, versioned object store that encodes objects across global data
centers. Giza implements the Paxos consensus algorithms on top of existing cloud
APIs and have separate data and metadata paths. As a result, Giza is fast in
normal operation for our target workloads. Our evaluation of Giza on a
deployment over \deployment demonstrates that Giza achieves much lower latency
than naively adopting a globally consistent storage system.
