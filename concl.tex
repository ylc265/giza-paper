\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of Giza - a strongly consistent, versioned object store that encodes objects across global data centers. Giza is built on top of existing cloud storage systems. 
Its architecture choice leads to simplified development, deployment and operation. Giza implements the Paxos consensus algorithms to achieve strong consistency. We address unique challenges implementing Paxos with restricted cloud storage APIs. We also heavily optimize Giza's data and metadata path. As a result, Giza is fast in normal operation for our target workloads.
Our evaluation of Giza on a deployment over xxx data centers demonstrates that Giza achieves much lower latency than naively adopting a globally consistent storage system.
