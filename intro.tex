\section{Intro}
Giza is a cloud storage front end that erasure codes large mutable data files across multiple data centers . The motivation of Giza is to reduce overall storage cost and to tolerate entire data center failures, while maintaining strong consistency and reasonable read and write latencies.

\subsection{Background}
Paxos is a consensus algorithm that satisfies the safety property in an asynchronous network. 
\par
Erasure Encoding is a very mature technique used in storage systems for data striping and fault tolerance.
