\begin{abstract}
  Microsoft Azure Storage is a global cloud storage system with a footprint in
  38 geographic regions. \del{It lets customers store seemingly limitless
    amounts of data.} To protect customer data against catastrophic failures of
  a data center, it optionally replicates \del{customer} data to secondary DCs
  \del{hundreds of miles away} \new{in a remote geographic region}. To lower the
  storage cost \del{required for maintaining} \new{for} geo-redundancy, this
  paper presents the design \del{implementation} and evaluation of Giza---a
  strongly consistent, versioned object store that applies erasure coding
  \del{on objects} across global data centers. \new{Using a novel implementation
    of well known distributed consensus algorithms tailored for restricted cloud
    APIs, Giza is able to reuse existing components to achieve single cross-DC
    round trip latency for its primary workloads. Our evaluation across 11 DCs
    in 3 continents demonstrate that Giza achieves its design goals.} \del{Giza
    is built on top of existing cloud storage systems. The architecture choice
    leads to simplified development, deployment, and operation. The key
    technical challenge is to achieve single cross-DC round trip latency for
    common reads and writes, while at the same time maintaining external
    consistency under uncommon contention. Giza addresses the challenge with a
    novel implementation of well-known distributed consensus algorithms tailored
    for restricted cloud storage APIs. Giza is deployed to \deployment and
    experimental results demonstrate that Giza achieves our design goals.}
