%\name{} unifies concurrency control and consensus by explicitly tracking the
%dependencies among transactions at server replicas involved in the
%transactions.  It collects and aggregates the dependency graph in one or two
%round-trips during transaction commit.  Doing so allows servers to
%deterministically break any cycles detected in the dependency graph by
%re-ordering operations whose execution is deferred to commit time.
