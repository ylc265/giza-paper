Microsoft Azure Storage is a global cloud storage system with a footprint in 38 geographic regions. It lets customers store seemingly limitless amounts of data. To protect customer data against the catastrophic failure of an entire data center, it optionally replicates customer data to
secondary DCs hundreds of miles away.

To lower the storage cost required for maintaining geo-redundancy, this paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of Giza - a strongly consistent, versioned object store that applies erasure coding on objects across global data centers. Giza is built on top of existing cloud storage systems. The architecture choice leads to simplified development, deployment and operation. The key technical challenge is to achieve single cross-DC round trip latency for common reads and writes, while at the same time maintaining external consistency under uncommon contention. Giza addresses the challenge with a novel implementation of well-known distributed consensus algorithms tailored for restricted cloud storage APIs. Giza is deployed to \deployment and experimental results demonstrate that Giza achieves our design goals.
