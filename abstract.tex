  Microsoft Azure Storage is a global cloud storage system with a footprint in
  38 geographic regions. To protect customer data against catastrophic data center failures,
	it optionally replicates data to secondary DCs hundreds of miles away.
	Using Microsoft OneDrive as an example,
	this paper illustrates the characteristics of typical cloud storage workloads and
	the opportunity to lower storage cost for geo-redundancy with erasure coding.

	The paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of Giza -- 
	a strongly consistent, versioned object store that applies erasure coding
  across global data centers.
	The key technical challenge Giza addresses is to achieve single cross-DC
	round trip latency for common reads and writes, while at the same time maintaining
	external consistency under uncommon contention.
	Giza addresses the challenge with a novel implementation of well-known
	distributed consensus algorithms tailored for restricted cloud storage APIs.
	Giza is deployed to \deployment and experimental results demonstrate
	that it achieves our design goals.
